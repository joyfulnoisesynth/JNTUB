JoyfulNoise Tiny Utility Board Firmware Library
-----------------------------------------------

This is the library that houses common code that can be used by any
JNTUB-based Eurorack module.

=== USAGE ===

To get this to work with Arduino IDE, you'll need to create a symlink/hardlink
to the firmware/JNTUB/ directory in your Arduino libraries directory.

See <https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries> for details.
